**Hello, I'm Cheng Sizhe,** currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science** at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, where I am part of the **Turing Honors Program**. I am deeply interested in research in the fields of <font color=Green>visualization (VIS)</font> and <font color=Blue>human-computer interaction (HCI)</font>.

My professional journey is characterized by a diverse range of research experiences and a robust skill set in programming. My key accomplishments include participating in the **ICPC algorithm competitions** (Also known as ACM Programming Contest) and winning two **<font color="A8A8A8">Silver Medals</font>** during my freshman and sophomore years, which greatly enhanced my algorithmic problem-solving skills.

I have also led several impactful projects, such as developing an interface for analyzing non-verbal interactions in educational environments and creating visualization tools for large language models. My technical proficiency spans across various programming languages like Java, C/C++, and Python, as well as front-end technologies including Vue, React, and D3.js. And I am also familar with **markdown** and $\LaTeX$.
