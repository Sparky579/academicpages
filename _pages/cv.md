## EDUCATION
**Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, Sept. 2021 -Jun. 2025  
Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science (Turing Honors Program)  
Overall GPA: 3.76/4.0

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**Feb. 2023 – Present**  
- Leading a research project aims to analyze non-verbal interactions between students and teachers, in conjunction with a large language model that analyzes the textual content of a teacher's lecture. The goal is to develop an interactive teaching behavior analysis interface that provides efficient feedback to teachers.

**Feb. 2023 – Present**  
- Exploring the development of visualization tools to assist researchers in the field of large language model multi-agents(Involving AutoGen, AutoGPT, etc.).  
- Deployed multiple large language models locally and written D3.js programs to embed and visualize datasets.

**Feb. 2023 –Jun. 2023**  
- Led a project focused on visualizing large-scale user comments data from the Stack Overflow website, showcased through the project repository.

**Feb. 2023 –Jun. 2023**  
- Engaged in designing a single-cycle CPU compatible with the MIPS32 instruction set, implementing functionalities excluding floating-point operations and exception handling.  
- Implemented modular design for potential pipeline integration.  
- Contributed to video processing with compressed keyframes and differential frames support. Successfully tested on FPGA hardware and screens (Using VGA to connect).  
- Personally handled encoding and debugging of major external IO devices.  
  [Computer Organization Project](https://github.com/IskXCr/CS202-CS214-Computer-Organization-Project)

**Feb. 2022–Feb. 2023**  
- Participated in the algorithm competition, showcasing expertise in various algorithms and data structures, and achieved two silver medals in Asia regional ICPC contests.

**Sept. 2022–Feb. 2023**  
- Designed a C++ Program that facilitates matrix multiplication across different data types, and increase efficiency using optimizations including loop restructuring, multi-threading, and Single Instruction Multiple Data(SIMD).  
- These amplify the program’s runtime efficiency by several orders of magnitude.
